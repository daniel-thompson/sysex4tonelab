=============

WARNING: sysex4tonelab is a work-in-progress and is not (yet) 
         sufficiently finished to do anything useful.

sysex4tonelab is a third party librarian for Vox's Tonelab ST
multi-effects pedal.

Installation
------------

During the development phase this program uses hbcxx
(http://hbcxx.sf.net) as its build system. Once hbcxx has been
installed there is no need to install the application, just run:
  ./sysex4tonelab

However if you would like to build an ELF executable then try:
  hbcxx --hbcxx-executable=src/sysex4tonelab sysex4tonelab
